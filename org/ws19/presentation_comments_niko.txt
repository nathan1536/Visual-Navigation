visnav presnetations

1. 14:00 - 14:15 Hsuan Hao Wang, Anselm Coogan: SLAM

- good intro, motivating relation to odom exercise
- black background slides -.-
- explained cov-graph well
- keyframe culling explained, good visual
- LC: detection and computing relative pose, lm merging
- No PGO: BFS to propagate pose update
- essential graph 
- video demonstrating all steps
- evaluation: qualitative map and trajectory results

- timing: first part Hao 5-6min, 7-8min, slightly over time


2. 14:15 - 14:30 Shristi Mudgal: BA-Net

- motivations: mono-depth ill posed, bringing geometric structure to DL
- intro/overview: a bit quick
- basis depthmaps: how are linear factors w optimized?
- Feature-Metric BA,
- differentiable LM: lmabda prediction network, fix number of iterations
- pseudocode with too much detail
- jacobian: too much detail
- results: loss curves, but no 3d results
- strange non-smooth point cloud
- timing: overtime 17:30


3. 14:45 - 15:00 Alona Sakhnenko: Photometric Bundle Adjustment

- motivation: relation to sfm
- photometric error and point parameterization
- candidate selection:
- lack of visuals for explanations
- "implemented functionality"
- point tracking?
- results: some numeric results, initial sfm error very high?
- no visualizations
- timing: short, 8min


4. 14:30 - 14:45 Florian Ã–lsner: Photometric Bundle Adjustment

- motivation: recap SfM, indirect vs direct
- explanation of photometric error: good, with visuals
- implementation aspects: map representation, bilateral filtering
- freezing pose parameters of low-constrained frames ?
- results: trajectory overview, numeric results similar accuracy to SfM (but no added information)
- timing: 10min, 3min questions



5. 15:00 - 15:15 Lex Meulenkamp: Indirect Visual Odometry with Optical Flow

- optical flow; visual
- brightness constancy: equations to motivate algorithm; neighbors move the same
- too deep dive into implementation details, indexing
- lack of overview of how optical flow fits in the overall pipeline
- visual results overall reasonable, some drift at the end
- no quantitative results ("WIP"); debugging of drift
- timing: too short 7:30 min



6. 15:15 - 15:30 Erkam Uyanik: Indirect Visual Odometry with Optical Flow

- motivation: difference to odometry exercise
- optical flow: brightness constancy, LK assumption (constant motion in neighborhood), coarse to fine
- overall pipeline overview
- FAST corner detecton
- visual for point selection with grid, step by step tracking results look good
- qualitative results: video, looks good
- quantitative results: slightly worse ATE, runtime better
- keyframe spacing larger, could explain worse ATE
- maybe it is relative to multithreading, b/c the tracking is faster
- idea: compute ate for all frames, also for ex5

- timing: good


7. 15:30 - 15:45 Joana Halili: SLAM
- orb slam overview
- explanation different stages with visuals
- covisibility graph
- map point culling
- lc detection based on proximity
- loop closing: observation merging open questions?
- qualitative results: video
- timing: ok
- optimization of essential graph? -> PGO, then full BA (check impl?)
