Balance of detail / overview: too much on MAP derivation?
Comments:
 - motivation in presentation sometimes missing (why image pyramid?)
 - interpretation of results "this looks terrible"
 - no keyframes, no motion prior in results. looks ok.

Clarity presentation: +/-, little bit confused
Balance of detail / overview:
Comments:
- mentioned: justification for 8 pixel pattern
- some details not explained too well for unfamiliar audience 
  (epipolar line search, "inverse depth is better numerically)
- iterate optimization and outlier removal
- Canny edge brought improvement over just adding some new points with high gradients
