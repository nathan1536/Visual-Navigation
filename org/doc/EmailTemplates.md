Subject: [VISNAV] Unregistering, course start, material for preparation

Dear participants of the Visual Navigation practical course in Summer 2021: 

Please consider the following information, in particular on UNREGISTERING (deadline March 31st). 

You may use the suggested exercises and reading material to prepare yourself for the course, but they are voluntary and up to your own discretion. 

In particular, it would be very helpful if you can make sure you have access to a development machine (Linux or macOS) before the first tutor session (see DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT below). 


UNREGISTERING: 

If for some reason you want to step back from the practical course, please unregister until March 31st latest (email visnav_ss2021@vision.in.tum.de). If you fail to unregister and still don't participate, the failed practical course (5.0) will appear on your transcript. It would also be nice if you inform us as soon as possible, if you cannot take part in the course for any reason. 


COURSE START: 

Due to the COVID-19 situation the course is fully online. On Monday April 19th at 4pm (sharp) we will have a first virtual tutor session on BBB. More infos on how to join and also some initial material to watch/prepare will be sent at the start of the lecture period. 

Please keep an eye on the course website (https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/ss2021/visnav_ss2021), which we will update with more information closer to the start of the course. 


DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT: 

We'll use a code framework for your implementation of exercises. We test and support Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, as well as macOS Catalina. Other recent Linux distributions and macOS Mojave will likely also work, but some fiddling with dependencies might be required (macOS Big Sur we haven't tried yet). Windows is not supported. You don't need a powerful GPU, but a reasonable CPU and sufficient RAM will make for a better coding experience. 

In case you don't have access to a Linux machine or a Mac already, you could prepare by either installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine, or as a dual-boot setup. 

In case you cannot use your own machine for some reason, there is also the possibility to use our lab machines remotely, although most people preferred using their own laptops in the past (even when the course was held offline). Nevertheless, if you'd like to try this option, let us know (ideally before the course starts). 

As part of the first exercise we'll go over how to setup your development environment and get started with the code framework. 


PROGRAMMING: 

As mentioned in the preliminary meeting, the exercises and project will be done in C++. If you would like to sharpen your C++ skills before the tutorial, the best thing is to practice programming, for example with some toy projects. You may also want to familiarize yourself with relevant software libraries, e.g. playing with their tutorials and examples. Relevant libraries include: 
- Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) 
- Sophus (https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus) 
- Ceres (http://ceres-solver.org/) 
- OpenGV (http://laurentkneip.github.io/opengv/) 
- (to a small extent) OpenCV (https://opencv.org/) 


RELATED COURSES AND MATERIAL: 

The following course has lecture recordings online. We suggest you have a look at those if you haven't done any course on 3D computer vision. 

- Computer Vision II: Multiple View Geometry, https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/online/mvg 

As additional reading material, the following book covers many aspects (also many beyond the course). You should focus on Part II and III and selected background from Part I as needed: 

- Timothy D. Barfoot, "State Estimation for Robotics", July 2017, Cambridge University Press 

Free pdf available: http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/bib/barfoot_ser17.pdf 


LITERATURE: 

You might also want to have a look at the following recent research papers related to the course content: 

- Edward Rosten et al., "Faster and better: a machine learning approach to corner detection" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.2434.pdf) 
- Michael Calonder et al., "BRIEF: Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features" (https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/149242/files/top_1.pdf 
- Ethan Rublee et al., "ORB: an efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF" (http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/orb_final.pdf) 
- RaÃºl Mur-Artal et al., "ORB-SLAM: A Versatile and Accurate Monocular SLAM System" (http://webdiis.unizar.es/~raulmur/MurMontielTardosTRO15.pdf) 
- Ethan Eade, "Lie Groups for 2D and 3D Transformations" (http://ethaneade.com/lie.pdf) --> compare also chapter 7 in the Barfoot book mentioned above 


See you all in April. 

Best regards, 
David, Jason and Niko

## After preparation is finished

```
Hi all,

welcome to the Vision-based Navigation practical course.

We have updated the information on the course website, please read it carefully. In particular you will find:
* times and dates, including (tentative) dates for the final presentation and report
* video lectures and slides
* link to BBB for tutor session
* link to student chat room (Matrix)
* registration form for gitlab accounts (for code and exercise sheets)
https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/ss2021/visnav_ss2021

The password for the non-public material / links on the course page is: visnav21ss

You can sign up for the gitlab accounts, where you will find the repository with exercises sheets and code framework. You need to enter your matriculation number on the course material page.

Once you can log into gitlab, you will find the exercise sheet in the corresponding folder, i.e. (replace "<username>"):
https://gitlab.vision.in.tum.de/visnav_ss21/<username>/visnav/-/tree/master/exercise_sheets

The video lectures are available on the course page. You should watch the first one today at 2pm (or earlier, if you want to).

The first virtual tutor session will start today at 4pm on BBB. We will have a Q&A on the lecture, and you can start to work on the first exercise sheet then. We will offer the opportunity to do a short round of introductions (voluntary), so be prepared to turn on your video, if you can and want to.

After the Q&A, your task in the tutor session will be setting up the code framework and getting started on the first exercise sheet.

Best,
Niko, Jason and David
